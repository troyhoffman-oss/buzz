//! Deriving the agent's public identity from the key it was minted with.
//!
//! `docs/remote-agents.md` §Deploy, **Step 0 — derive and verify identity**:
//!
//! > The payload carries the nsec, not the pubkey. Before any substrate read or
//! > mutation, the provider MUST parse `private_key_nsec` and derive the public
//! > key from it; a malformed or undecodable key is an immediate in-band error.
//! > Every selector, name, and comparison below uses the *derived* pubkey —
//! > never a caller-supplied one.
//!
//! That is the strict reading, and it is the one this module implements. The
//! payload's `pubkey` field is retained on the wire, but it is demoted from
//! *identity* to *assertion*: [`derive_pubkey`] produces the identity, and a
//! payload pubkey that disagrees with it is a fatal in-band error rather than a
//! value that wins. The reason the field cannot simply be trusted is the same
//! reason the spec says "never a caller-supplied one": the unit slug, the env
//! file name and `backend_agent_id` are all keyed on it, so a payload whose
//! pubkey and nsec disagree would name a unit after one identity and run it
//! under another — an agent that looks deployed and is permanently unreachable,
//! which is exactly the failure the fail-closed nsec check already guards.
//!
//! Every buffer this module owns holds the decoded key as `Zeroizing`, so the
//! 32 secret bytes are wiped when derivation finishes rather than left on the
//! stack. `secp256k1::SecretKey` does *not* erase itself on drop — it exposes
//! `non_secure_erase` instead — so this module calls that explicitly before
//! the key goes out of scope. What remains is the by-value copy
//! `SecretKey::from_byte_array` takes, which no caller can reach; the crate's
//! own documentation is candid that fully preventing such copies is not
//! something a library can promise. This is best-effort hygiene on a value
//! that lives for microseconds, not a claim of guaranteed erasure.
